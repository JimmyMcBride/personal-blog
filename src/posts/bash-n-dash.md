Welcome back, fellow shell wizards! üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Now that we‚Äôve got you comfortable with the basics of the terminal, it‚Äôs time to really dig into the **core commands** you‚Äôll be using on a daily basis. These commands are like your spellbook‚Äîmaster them, and you‚Äôll be able to conjure up powerful actions with just a few keystrokes. We‚Äôll cover the most essential commands for **file manipulation, text manipulation, and permissions**. And, because you‚Äôre on your fast track to shell mastery, I‚Äôll show you how to combine them to level up your workflow.

---

### **File Manipulation Commands**

File manipulation is the bread and butter of your command-line experience. You‚Äôll be moving, copying, and deleting files constantly, so these commands will quickly become second nature.

#### **1. Copy Files (`cp`)**

Want to make a copy of a file? Easy:

```bash
cp original.txt copy.txt
```

This creates a duplicate of `original.txt` called `copy.txt`. If you‚Äôre copying a directory and its contents, use the `-r` flag for **recursive**:

```bash
cp -r source_directory/ destination_directory/
```

#### **2. Move/Rename Files (`mv`)**

Need to move a file? The `mv` command is your go-to. This moves `file.txt` to a new directory:

```bash
mv file.txt /path/to/destination/
```

Want to rename a file? The `mv` command handles that too:

```bash
mv oldname.txt newname.txt
```

One command, two purposes‚Äîhow efficient is that? üòâ

#### **3. Delete Files (`rm`)**

Be careful with this one! Deleting files is easy with `rm`, but remember‚Äîthere‚Äôs **no trash bin**. Once it‚Äôs gone, it‚Äôs gone for good.

To delete a file:

```bash
rm file.txt
```

To delete a directory and all its contents, use the recursive `-r` flag (and maybe take a deep breath before hitting Enter):

```bash
rm -rf folder_name/
```

Use this command carefully, especially when you‚Äôre working with important files. Triple-check your target!

### **Text Manipulation Commands**

Next up: working with text files. Whether you‚Äôre extracting info or transforming text, these commands are essential to any shell wizard's toolkit.

#### **1. View File Contents (`cat`)**

The `cat` command lets you quickly view the contents of a file:

```bash
cat file.txt
```

It‚Äôs simple, but when combined with other commands (like `grep`), it becomes way more powerful.

#### **2. Search Inside Files (`grep`)**

Need to find a specific line of text in a file? `grep` is like a magical search tool for text files:

```bash
grep "search_term" file.txt
```

It‚Äôll search through the file and show you all the lines containing `"search_term"`. Combine this with `cat` to search through a whole directory of files:

```bash
cat *.txt | grep "search_term"
```

#### **3. Stream Editing (`sed`)**

Want to replace specific text within a file? `sed` (stream editor) is your best friend for quick, in-place edits. Let‚Äôs say you want to replace ‚Äúhello‚Äù with ‚Äúgoodbye‚Äù:

```bash
sed 's/hello/goodbye/g' file.txt
```

This command will output the updated content to the terminal. If you want to **save** the changes back to the file, use the `-i` flag:

```bash
sed -i 's/hello/goodbye/g' file.txt
```

#### **4. Awkwardly Powerful (`awk`)**

Don‚Äôt be put off by `awk`‚Äôs intimidating syntax‚Äîonce you get used to it, it‚Äôs a powerhouse for processing and analyzing text files. Here‚Äôs an example that prints the first column of a file:

```bash
awk '{print $1}' file.txt
```

There‚Äôs a whole lot you can do with `awk`, but we‚Äôll keep it simple for now.

### **Permissions and File Ownership**

In the world of Linux, every file and directory has a set of permissions and an owner. Understanding how to manage these is key to keeping your system secure and organized.

#### **1. Change File Permissions (`chmod`)**

Let‚Äôs break this down: permissions determine **who** can read, write, or execute a file. To view file permissions, use:

```bash
ls -l
```

The output will look something like this:

```bash
-rw-r--r-- 1 user group 4096 Sep 16 12:34 file.txt
```

Here, the first part (`-rw-r--r--`) represents the permissions:

- The owner can read and write (`rw`).
- The group and others can only read (`r--`).

To change permissions, use `chmod`. If you want to give the owner execute permissions, for example:

```bash
chmod u+x file.txt
```

You can also use numeric mode (e.g., `755`):

```bash
chmod 755 file.txt
```

#### **2. Change File Ownership (`chown`)**

The `chown` command is used to change the owner of a file. Here‚Äôs how you‚Äôd give ownership of `file.txt` to a user named `newowner`:

```bash
chown newowner file.txt
```

You can also change both the owner and the group:

```bash
chown newowner:newgroup file.txt
```

### **Combining Commands**

Now that you‚Äôve got the basics, let‚Äôs talk about **combining** these commands to work faster and smarter. One of the best things about the shell is how you can pipe commands together to create powerful one-liners.

For example, here‚Äôs how to search for a word in all `.txt` files and display the results with line numbers:

```bash
grep -n "search_term" *.txt
```

Or, if you want to search, replace, and save changes in multiple files:

```bash
grep -l "old_text" *.txt | xargs sed -i 's/old_text/new_text/g'
```

### **Wrapping Up**

By now, you‚Äôve learned the essentials of file manipulation, text processing, and managing permissions. These commands are like the spells you‚Äôll use every day in your shell wizardry. Once you‚Äôve mastered them, you‚Äôll be able to fly through tasks that would take ages with a graphical interface.

In the next part of this series, we‚Äôll dive even deeper into shell scripting and automating your workflow. Until then, keep practicing‚Äîshell mastery is all about repetition and building your muscle memory.
