Welcome to the third post in the **Textual Healing** series! In this article, we’re diving deep into the world of **`awk`**—a tool that’s awkwardly powerful (pun intended) when it comes to processing and analyzing text.

`awk` is an incredibly useful tool for text processing, especially for working with data in columns. Think of `awk` as a mini-programming language built into your terminal that helps you extract, manipulate, and transform text with specific patterns.

To help you follow along, we’ll use this sample `file.txt`:

```
Name    Age    Salary
Alice   25     50000
Bob     30     55000
Charlie 35     60000
Dave    40     65000
```

### **1. The Basics of `awk`**

At its simplest, `awk` operates on **fields**, which are like columns of data. Let’s use `awk` to print specific columns from `file.txt`. To print the first column (which is the **Name**):

```bash
awk '{print $1}' file.txt
```

**Output**:

```
Name
Alice
Bob
Charlie
Dave
```

- **$1** represents the first column, `$2` would be the second column, and so on.
- **$0** represents the entire line.

If you want to print the second and third columns (for **Age** and **Salary**):

```bash
awk '{print $2, $3}' file.txt
```

**Output**:

```
Age Salary
25  50000
30  55000
35  60000
40  65000
```

### **2. Custom Field Separators**

By default, `awk` uses spaces or tabs as the field separator. But what if your data is separated by commas, like in a CSV file? You can specify the field separator using the **`-F`** option. Here’s an example:

Let’s say we had a comma-separated version of `file.txt`:

```
Name,Age,Salary
Alice,25,50000
Bob,30,55000
Charlie,35,60000
Dave,40,65000
```

Now, if you want to print the **Name** and **Salary** columns, you’d do this:

```bash
awk -F ',' '{print $1, $3}' file.csv
```

**Output**:

```
Name Salary
Alice 50000
Bob 55000
Charlie 60000
Dave 65000
```

---

### **3. Pattern Matching with `awk`**

You can also use `awk` to search for patterns in the data. For instance, if you want to print the **Name** of anyone who has a **Salary** over 55,000, you can use a pattern match like this:

```bash
awk '$3 > 55000 {print $1}' file.txt
```

**Output**:

```
Charlie
Dave
```

This command checks if the third column (Salary) is greater than 55,000 and prints the **Name** column for matching rows.

---

### **4. Conditionals and Calculations**

`awk` can perform conditional logic and arithmetic on the data. Suppose you want to give everyone a **5% raise** and print the new salary:

```bash
awk '{new_salary = $3 * 1.05; print $1, new_salary}' file.txt
```

**Output**:

```
Name    52500
Alice   52500
Bob     57750
Charlie 63000
Dave    68250
```

Here, we multiply the third column (Salary) by 1.05 and print the new value along with the person’s name.

### **5. Output Formatting**

Want to format your output neatly? Use `awk`’s `printf` function to add custom formatting. For example, if you want to print each person’s **Name** and **Salary** in a structured format:

```bash
awk '{printf "Name: %s, Salary: $%.2f\n", $1, $3}' file.txt
```

**Output**:

```
Name: Alice, Salary: $50000.00
Name: Bob, Salary: $55000.00
Name: Charlie, Salary: $60000.00
Name: Dave, Salary: $65000.00
```

This example uses `printf` to format the **Salary** with two decimal places.

### **6. Summarizing Data with `awk`**

`awk` is incredibly handy for summarizing data. Let’s calculate the **total salary** and **average salary** of all employees.

- **Sum of salaries**:

```bash
awk '{sum += $3} END {print "Total Salary:", sum}' file.txt
```

**Output**:

```
Total Salary: 230000
```

- **Average salary**:

```bash
awk '{sum += $3; count++} END {print "Average Salary:", sum/count}' file.txt
```

**Output**:

```
Average Salary: 57500
```

### **7. Real-World Use Cases for `awk`**

Here are some practical ways to use `awk` with a file like `file.txt`:

- **Find all employees over 30 years old**:

  ```bash
  awk '$2 > 30 {print $1, $2}' file.txt
  ```

  **Output**:

  ```
  Charlie 35
  Dave    40
  ```

- **Give all employees a 7% bonus and print the new salary**:

  ```bash
  awk '{bonus = $3 * 0.07; new_salary = $3 + bonus; print $1, new_salary}' file.txt
  ```

  **Output**:

  ```
  Alice   53500
  Bob     58850
  Charlie 64200
  Dave    69550
  ```

### **Wrapping Up**

`awk` is a powerhouse for working with structured data in text files. From extracting and summarizing data to performing complex calculations and pattern matching, `awk` offers flexibility and power that makes text processing much easier.

Next time you need to process data from logs, CSVs, or any column-based file, remember that `awk` is here to help. With just a little practice, you’ll be using `awk` like a pro!
