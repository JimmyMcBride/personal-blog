If you've spent any amount of time learning to code, you've likely encountered what many developers call "tutorial hell." In the beginning, tutorials are a lifeline—guiding you through each line of code, explaining concepts in digestible chunks, and giving you a sense of accomplishment as you complete projects you never thought possible. However, as you mature as a developer, tutorials can quickly become a poison.

### The Trap of Tutorial Hell

The issue with relying too heavily on tutorials is that they can lull you into a false sense of progress. You feel like you're learning because you're building things that work, but the truth is, you're often just following instructions without deeply understanding why something works. Once you try to start a project on your own, the confidence crumbles. You realize that, without the handholding, you're not quite sure how to get from point A to point B.

That’s the trap: the more you rely on tutorials, the less confident you become in solving problems on your own. The tutorial might give you a clear path, but in real development, the path is rarely clear. **That’s why, as you grow as a developer, it’s crucial to break out of tutorial hell as quickly as you can.**

### Why Planning Your Own Projects is Key

When you're no longer a complete beginner, starting your own projects becomes the fastest way to truly learn. Tutorials provide a narrow view of the problem space, while real-world projects push you to think creatively, make decisions, and solve problems that don't have clear answers in a step-by-step guide.

Planning your own projects helps you understand how to break down a big idea into smaller, manageable tasks, and forces you to think through architecture, design, and implementation from scratch. This is the kind of skill that separates a junior developer from an experienced one.

I highly recommend checking out my [blog post on planning a project from scratch](https://jimmymcbride.dev/blog/planning-a-project-from-scratch) for a step-by-step guide on how to approach project planning. It’s one of the most important skills you can develop, and it's something you’ll use throughout your entire career.

### When (and How) to Use Tutorials

Now, don’t get me wrong—tutorials still have their place, even for more advanced developers. The key is to **shift how you use them**. Instead of following a full tutorial from start to finish, pick specific sections to study. For example, if you're stuck on implementing a complex feature, it can be useful to open up a tutorial’s codebase to see how they solved that specific problem.

Here’s the trick: don’t just copy the code. Take time to understand how it works, why certain decisions were made, and whether you can implement a similar solution in your own codebase. The ability to read and understand someone else’s code is one of the most valuable skills a developer can have.

In fact, **reading and dissecting code is far more powerful than watching hours of video tutorials.** Put on some lo-fi music, open the codebase, and start digging through someone else’s project. This kind of hands-on learning builds your problem-solving skills and gives you a deeper understanding of how different systems fit together.

### Become a Developer Who Loves to Read the Docs

This brings us to a critical point: if you're not the kind of person who “reads the docs,” you're going to have a hard time growing as a developer. The sooner you embrace documentation, the more effective you’ll be on your journey. Docs aren't boring—they're your key to unlocking deeper understanding.

Here’s a tip: use **positive self-talk** to reshape how you see yourself. Tell yourself, “I’m the kind of developer who loves reading the docs.” This shift in mindset can dramatically increase your efficiency. Documentation is filled with hidden gems that tutorials often gloss over, and getting comfortable with reading and understanding it will give you the confidence to tackle any project.

### Why Tutorials Will Become the Slowest Way to Learn

As you advance, you’ll notice that tutorials are often the slowest way to learn new concepts. They focus on handholding and covering basics, whereas diving into real-world problems, studying the docs, and reviewing existing codebases push you to learn at a much faster pace. As you grow in your skills, you need to develop the ability to learn by solving problems, not by watching others solve them for you.

**The faster you break out of tutorial hell, the faster you’ll grow.** So don’t be afraid to take on your own projects, experiment with different solutions, and make mistakes. That’s where the real learning happens.

### Embrace Your Own Path

The best way to become a better developer is to start **building things your way**. You won’t have the safety net of a tutorial, and that’s okay. You’ll make mistakes, hit roadblocks, and question your decisions, but each mistake is a valuable lesson. Every challenge you overcome will help you grow, and before you know it, you’ll be solving problems without needing step-by-step instructions.

So, go ahead—plan your own project, dive into docs, and tackle problems on your own. Don’t rely on tutorials forever. **You are capable of figuring things out.** The journey from beginner to confident developer is paved with plenty of mistakes, but each one brings you closer to mastery.
