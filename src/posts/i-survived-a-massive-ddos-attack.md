title: "I Survived a Massive DDoS Attack and Made My Server Bulletproof"
description: "After facing a massive DDoS attack on my self-hosted server, I learned the hard way how important firewalls areâ€”especially cloud firewalls that can stop malicious traffic before it even reaches your server. In this blog, I share my journey from near-server meltdown to bulletproofing my setup, exploring the difference between traditional and cloud firewalls, and how a few simple steps can protect your server from hackers and their bots. If you're thinking about self-hosting, you won't want to miss this!"

So, maybe you can relate... I can be a bit of a noob sometimes! I decided to migrate my website to 100% open-source and self-hosted tools, and I forgot one major step. I didnâ€™t fully understand that step, so now I want to help you understand how **not** to get every hacker and their dog's bot spamming the open SSH port you forgot to hide behind a firewall. ðŸ˜¬

## Firewalls! ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

Letâ€™s talk about firewalls! There are 2 types of firewalls we need to know about: cloud firewalls and traditional firewalls.

- **Traditional Firewall**: A traditional firewall is a security system installed directly on your serverâ€™s hardware. It sets up rules for who is allowed to connect to what port on your server. Itâ€™s a very useful tool for making sure only the right people have access to a given port. However...
- **Cloud Firewall**: A cloud firewall is a network-level firewall. Whatâ€™s significant about this is that it can stop traffic **before it even reaches your server**!

So, while I **did** set up key-based authentication on my server, making it impossible for anyone to brute force their way in, the number of denied requests to that server consumed a lot of CPU and IO rateâ€”enough to take my site down! Trying to figure out what was happening was almost impossible because the server was so slow! Even setting up the traditional firewall didnâ€™t stop hackers from bombarding my SSH port! However, once I set up a cloud firewall through my provider (DigitalOcean, not a sponsor but open to the idea ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰), the bots couldnâ€™t even reach my serverâ€™s SSH port at all. No need for obscurity! I can keep my SSH on port 22, and you canâ€™t even touch it! ðŸš€

However, I canâ€™t block website traffic to my blog, so I can still be DDoSed through those ports, but hey, a winâ€™s a win!
