If you're here, you're probably about to embark on your first-ever Arch Linux installation, and let me tell you, that can seem pretty intimidating at first glance. But donâ€™t worryâ€”youâ€™re not alone! Weâ€™re going to take this one step at a time, and Iâ€™ll guide you through every part of the process as you venture into the wonderful world of Arch Linux.

**Pro tip**: If this is your **first time** installing Arch, I recommend giving it a try on a **virtual machine** first. That way, you can get a feel for the steps without worrying about messing up your main system. Once you're comfortable, you can tackle the real deal with confidence!

---

### **1. Prepare the Installation Medium**

- Download the latest **Arch Linux ISO** from the [official site](https://archlinux.org/download/).
- Create a bootable USB using a tool like `dd`, Rufus, or Etcher.

### **2. Boot the System from the USB**

- Insert the USB, reboot your computer, and select the USB device from your BIOS/UEFI boot menu.
- When the boot loader appears, select **Arch Linux install medium** and press `Enter`.

### **3. Set the Console Keyboard Layout**

Since we're in the USA, set the keyboard layout to American English:

```bash
loadkeys us
```

### **4. Verify the Boot Mode (UEFI vs BIOS)**

- Run this command to confirm you're in UEFI mode (64-bit):

  ```bash
  ls /sys/firmware/efi
  ```

- If the directory exists, you're in UEFI mode. Otherwise, youâ€™re in BIOS mode.

### **5. Connect to the Internet**

- To verify network devices:

  ```bash
  ip link
  ```

- For **Ethernet**: You should be automatically connected if the cable is plugged in.
- For **Wi-Fi**:

  ```bash
  iwctl
  ```

  - Use `device list`, `station DEVICE scan`, `station DEVICE get-networks`, and `station DEVICE connect SSID` to connect.

- Verify the connection:

  ```bash
  ping archlinux.org
  ```

### **6. Update the System Clock**

- Run this command to synchronize your system clock:

  ```bash
  timedatectl set-ntp true
  ```

### **7. Partition the Disk**

Partitioning can be confusing, especially if itâ€™s your first time. Hereâ€™s a quick breakdown: a **partition** is just a section of your hard drive dedicated to specific tasksâ€”like storing files or acting as the bootloader. In Linux, we often divide the disk into several partitions, and for Arch Linux, the main ones weâ€™ll need are for the **root system** and the **EFI boot**.

**Important:** Be **absolutely sure** you're working on the correct drive. Double and triple-check, or you risk losing all of your data. Trust me, Iâ€™ve accidentally wiped my data more times than I care to admit by not being careful enough with this step!

When you enter `fdisk`, things might seem a bit cryptic, so letâ€™s make it easy. To create a new partition, use the following steps:

- Identify your disk:

  ```bash
  fdisk -l
  ```

- Partition your disk using **fdisk** (assuming `/dev/sda`):

  ```bash
  fdisk /dev/sda
  ```

- Create the following partitions:

  1. **EFI System Partition** (FAT32, ~512MB) for UEFI systems.
  2. **Root Partition** (ext4, at least 30GB).

- Type **`n`** to create a new partition.
- Select the partition number (usually **1** for the first partition).
- For the **partition type**, choose **23** (Linux root x86-64).
- After selecting the partition size (I recommend at least 30GB for the root partition), youâ€™ll move on to the next one.

### **8. Format the Partitions**

- Format the **root** partition as ext4:

  ```bash
  mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdaX
  ```

- Format the **EFI** partition (for UEFI systems):

  ```bash
  mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/sdaY
  ```

### **9. Create a Swap File (Instead of Swap Partition)**

While some users still opt for a swap partition, a **swap file** is more flexible and easier to resize later. Swap is useful when your system runs out of RAM or when you want to hibernate your computer.

- **How to size the swap file**:
  - **If you donâ€™t hibernate**: A swap file about half the size of your RAM is usually enough.
  - **If you hibernate**: The swap file should be equal to or slightly larger than your RAM.

**Why hibernation matters**: Laptops benefit from hibernation since you can save your session and resume later without losing your work. On desktops, itâ€™s less critical, especially if you shut down your system regularly (like I doâ€”it keeps my setup clutter-free!).

To create a 4GB swap file (adjust as needed for your setup):

```bash
fallocate -l 4G /swapfile
chmod 600 /swapfile
mkswap /swapfile
swapon /swapfile
```

- Add the swap file to `fstab` for persistence:

  ```bash
  echo '/swapfile none swap defaults 0 0' | tee -a /etc/fstab
  ```

### **10. Mount the File Systems**

- Mount the root partition:

  ```bash
  mount /dev/sdaX /mnt
  ```

- Mount the EFI partition (for UEFI):

  ```bash
  mkdir /mnt/boot
  mount /dev/sdaY /mnt/boot
  ```

### **11. Install the Base System**

- Install the base packages:

  ```bash
  pacstrap /mnt base linux linux-firmware
  ```

### **12. Generate the fstab File**

- Generate the file system table:

  ```bash
  genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
  ```

### **13. Chroot into the New System**

- Change root into the new system:

  ```bash
  arch-chroot /mnt
  ```

### **14. Set the Time Zone**

- Set your time zone to CST (Central Standard Time):

  ```bash
  ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/Chicago /etc/localtime
  hwclock --systohc
  ```

### **15. Localization**

- Edit `/etc/locale.gen` to uncomment `en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8`.
- Generate the locales:

  ```bash
  locale-gen
  ```

- Set the **locale**:

  ```bash
  echo "LANG=en_US.UTF-8" > /etc/locale.conf
  ```

### **16. Configure the Network**

- Set the hostname (we'll keep it lighthearted with **archbtw**):

  ```bash
  echo "archbtw" > /etc/hostname
  ```

- Edit `/etc/hosts`:

  ```bash
  127.0.0.1 localhost
  ::1       localhost
  127.0.1.1 archbtw.localdomain archbtw
  ```

### **17. Install NetworkManager, base-devel, and git**

**Pro tip**: I always forget to install NetworkManager, and it causes major headaches when I canâ€™t connect to the internet. Save yourself the trouble!

```bash
pacman -S networkmanager base-devel git
systemctl enable NetworkManager
```

### **18. Create a New User Before Rebooting**

Before rebooting, letâ€™s create a user account:

```bash
useradd -m -G wheel -s /bin/bash yourusername
passwd yourusername
```

- Enable the user to use sudo by editing the sudoers file:

```bash
EDITOR=vi visudo
```

Uncomment this line:

```bash
%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL
```

### **19. Install and Configure the Bootloader**

For **UEFI** systems, install and configure GRUB:

- Install GRUB and EFI boot manager:

  ```bash
  pacman -S grub efibootmgr
  ```

- Install GRUB to the EFI directory:

  ```bash
  grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot --bootloader-id=GRUB
  ```

- Generate the GRUB configuration file:

  ```bash
  grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
  ```

### **20. Set Root Password**

- Set the root password:

  ```bash
  passwd
  ```

### **21. Reboot into the New System**

- Exit the chroot environment:

  ```bash
  exit
  ```

- Unmount partitions:

  ```bash
  umount -R /mnt
  ```

- Reboot:

  ```bash
  reboot
  ```
