# Project Agent Contract

<!-- brain:begin agents-contract -->
Use this file as a Brain-managed project context entrypoint for `personal-blog`.

Read the linked context files before substantial work. Prefer the `brain` skill and `brain` CLI for project memory, retrieval, and durable context updates.

## Required Workflow

1. If no validated session is active, run `brain session start --task "<task>"`.
2. If a session is already active, run `brain session validate` before substantial work.
3. Read this file and the linked context files needed for the task.
4. Compile the smallest justified working set with `brain context compile --task "<task>"`.
5. Retrieve project memory with `brain find personal-blog` or `brain search "personal-blog <task>"` when the compiled packet is not enough.
6. Use `brain edit` for durable context updates to AGENTS.md, docs, or .brain notes.
7. Use `brain session run -- <command>` for required verification commands.
8. Finish with `brain session finish` so policy checks can enforce verification and surface promotion review when durable follow-through is still needed.

## Local Notes

Add repo-specific notes here. `brain context refresh` preserves content outside managed blocks.
