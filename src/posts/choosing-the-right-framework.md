The hype train in software development is endless. It seems like every week, there’s a new framework, tool, or technology that everyone’s raving about. But as developers, we need time to breathe and reflect. So, when should we jump on board the hype train, and when is it time to get off? The answer is deeply personal for each of us, but I’d like to share my perspective in the hope it might help you navigate this decision.

### The Turning Point: When Enough Is Enough

At some point, most developers come to a realization: learning every new framework and tool out there isn’t practical, and it doesn’t necessarily advance your career. You can look at seasoned developers who use older tech stacks and still build incredible, modern applications.

Let me share a quick story. I was playing an online game that had a bunch of helpful community-built tools—websites, Discord integrations, databases. After a while, I realized these were all built by the same person. Naturally, being a fresh developer who was up-to-date on the latest trends, I thought, "Surely this guy is using all the newest, hottest frameworks!"

But when I reached out to him, I was floored. He was using PHP! That’s right—PHP with Laravel and Bootstrap. He had built a digital empire using these tools, and he made a living off it. His nemesis? JavaScript. He used the absolute minimum of it, relying instead on PHP and robust servers to do the heavy lifting.

This was an eye-opener for me. You don’t need to use the latest bells and whistles to build something great. At some point, you have to ask yourself: **Do I enjoy learning new things for the sake of learning, or do I want to build something meaningful?**

### The Dangers of Shiny Object Syndrome

If your goal is to build something great, constantly chasing after new frameworks and technologies—what we call "shiny object syndrome"—can hold you back. While it’s essential to stay updated, endless tinkering without practical application can slow you down when you should be focusing on execution.

But, let’s be clear—there are people who thrive on tinkering and learning for the sheer joy of it. These people are vital to progress and innovation. Their knowledge is wide, and they often make great consultants because of it. The world needs both builders and tinkerers. So, which one are you?

### Finding Your Focus: Builder or Tinkerer?

#### For Builders:
If you have a project in mind, ask yourself:
- **What stack do I know best?**
- **Is this stack enough to build what I want to build?**
- **What are the smallest, most necessary changes or additions I could make to this stack to bring my vision to life?**

Once you have those answers, put on your blinders and focus. Shiny object syndrome will only distract you from reaching your goals. The best path to success is using the tools you’re already proficient with, and tweaking only when absolutely necessary.

#### For Tinkerers:
If you don’t have a dream project yet, or if you simply enjoy experimenting, then tinkering can be incredibly rewarding. Try out the latest frameworks, build the same app in 10 different stacks, compare them, and share your insights. The world needs tinkerers too. You might find your passion in experimentation and even turn it into a blog, YouTube channel, or consulting business.

For both groups, the key is balance. If you’re early in your career, you need to experiment to discover what you like, but you also need to focus deeply on one thing to establish expertise and find your place in the job market.

### The Path Forward: Plan, Focus, and Stay True to Your Goals

If you’re a builder, keep your eyes on the prize. Plan your projects, stay focused, and don’t get lost in the hype. You can check out my blog on [planning projects from scratch](https://jimmymcbride.dev/blog/planning-a-project-from-scratch) if you need help organizing your thoughts.

If you’re a tinkerer, listen to your heart and embrace it. Experiment, learn, and share your knowledge with the community. Tinkerers are the lifeblood of innovation, and there’s a lot of value in exploring new tech. Just be mindful not to spread yourself too thin.

### Final Thoughts

Whether you’re a builder or a tinkerer, the key to success is understanding your goals and staying true to them. Shiny object syndrome is real, and it can derail you if you’re not careful. But if you have a clear vision, you’ll know when to focus and when to explore.

Until next time, happy coding!
